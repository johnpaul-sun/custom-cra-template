/** Quick Guide on how this thing works.
 * Import the folder of your Test Routes here, then add it in the export section.
 *
 * Testing your Routes can save you time when debugging a component or something in the long run.
 * The steps and explanation for how this thing works are essentially the same as for how the index thing works.
 * We just added the test folder so that when we import all of the test routes, the test file will be used.
 *
 * When importing a test component, it is recommended that you add a Test beside the name.
 * This will remind you that you're using the test file,
 * and that you should switch to the default file once all of the tests have been completed.
